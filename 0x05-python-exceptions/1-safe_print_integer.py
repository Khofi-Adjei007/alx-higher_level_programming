    """
    Safely prints an integer using "{:d}".format().

    Args:
        value: The value to print.

    Returns:
        bool: True if value has been correctly
        printed as an integer, False otherwise.

    Description:
        This function takes a value as input and attempts to
        format it as an integer using the "{:d}".format() syntax.
        If the formatting is successful, the integer value is printed
        followed by a new line, and True is returned.

        If the value cannot be formatted as an integer due
        to a ValueError or TypeError, False is returned.

        The function uses a try-except block to catch any exceptions
        that may occur during the formatting process.
